# SpaceT
imagine space invaders and tetris combined into one game.
that is the point of this project.
so far in the development we have a semi working copy of tetris.
the game will be split into two different modes one version your playing tetris
the second mode you will be playing space invaders.


while your playing tetris everytime you destroy a row 
an extra set of strong enemies will be sent to the space invaders side. 
these enemies will be marked so to distuginush them from the rest. 

while your playing tetris special pieces will be generated by the opponenet.
these pieces are designed to be difficult to put together in a easy fashion.

the space invaders side of game will shoot down enemies either generated by the game or
the tetris side of the game. 
after a certain number of perfectly accurate shots or quickly destroying enemies
a special tetris block(s) will be generated on the tetris side.

this game is planning to support three basic modes
two player - local - same computer* this is the one we are working hardest toward.
single player 
two player - multiplayer
